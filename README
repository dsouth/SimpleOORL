A simple, minimal RogueLike demo (an @ moving around a hardcoded map) 
implemented in multiple languages.

Trying to follow the idioms of those languages and keep things very, very 
simple.

Would love to see more languages in here or improvements made by people who 
know any of these languages better than I do.

This is a refactoring of SimpleRL to use simple OO. Forked from:
https://github.com/nrkn/SimpleRL

I have removed languages from SimpleRL that are not suitable for OO, but 
perhaps you are using a dialect that does support OO or are a masochist and
want to implement OO yourself, go for it!

Most of the languages have not been refactored yet, the commit message 
reflects this:

Cloned from SimpleRL, needs refactoring to OO please

NEW:
  I've created a new repository for SimpleRLGolf, implement SimpleRL in as few
  bytes as possible:
    https://github.com/nrkn/SimpleRLGolf

Planned forks, implenting the following in all languages:
  very naive oo version (this fork! see https://github.com/nrkn/SimpleRL for the original)
  Then, the following to be added:
    more expandable and modular version
      a very simple map generator
        from there, in unknown order:
          - multiple levels
          - items/inventory
          - enemies/combat/player stats
          - fov
          - win condition/goal
          - other niceties
